/* P2.1: Write a program called FourRectanglePrinter that constructs a Rectangle objcet, prints its location by calling
System.out.prinlt(box), and then translates and prints it three more times, so that, if the rectangles were drawn, they
would form one large rectangle. Your program will not produce a drawing. It will simply print the locations of the four
rectangles */
